/**
 * Background-task registry — the on-disk layer behind the four `myflow_bg_*`
 * tools (`myflow_bg_start` / `myflow_bg_output` / `myflow_bg_list` /
 * `myflow_bg_stop`, added in later batches).
 *
 * A *background task* is a command that outlives the session that started it,
 * so its bookkeeping cannot live in memory. Everything is one file per task
 * under `.myflow/.runtime/background/` (the `.runtime` tree is gitignored, the
 * same place `sessions/` and `subagent-logs/` already use):
 *
 *   <taskId>.json   registry entry — written only by the tools (ADR-4)
 *   <taskId>.log    command output — written by `bg_runner.mjs` via the kernel
 *   <taskId>.exit   how the command ended — written by `bg_runner.mjs`
 *   cursors/<contextKey>__<taskId>.json   per-session read cursor (ADR-5)
 *
 * One file per task rather than one shared `tasks.json`: concurrent sessions
 * never write the same file, so there is no lost-update race and no lock. The
 * cost is that `listEntries` reads a directory and parses each file, which is
 * cheap at this scale.
 *
 * This module is deliberately **pure I/O**: no Pi imports, no tool
 * registration, and a *fixed* status precedence (see `resolveStatus`). The
 * tools build on it; it never reaches back into `./index.ts`, which keeps it
 * importable under `node --test` and free of a registration cycle (the same
 * dependency-injection shape `ask.ts` and `approval.ts` use).
 *
 * Known limits, stated honestly (`design.md` §8):
 *   - There is an orphan window: if the tool crashes after spawning the wrapper
 *     but before `writeEntry`, the process runs with no registry entry and
 *     `listEntries` cannot see it. No transactional compensation is attempted.
 *   - A stop that force-kills the wrapper leaves `status: "stopped"` with no
 *     exit code; `exit_code` is therefore nullable everywhere.
 *   - Liveness is `process.kill(pid, 0)`, which can mistake a reused PID for the
 *     original task. A present `.exit` record always outranks it.
